Rewrite the cat.c program by using read, write, open and close instead of their library equivalents.
When using or administrating linux system you are usually confronted with a command line. There are no graphical aids such as mouse or windows to help you navigate through directories or edit files. Linux system from administration point of view consists of multiple configuration files so called config files. By editing or creating these files an administrator is changing the behaviour of various services available within the system. Another situation where you can encounter text files are log files. Log files are produced by services running on the system. Information stored in the log file is there for the administrator as a help to troubleshoot and optimize running services. 
Whether we are talking about linux log files or config files we are, even so, talking about simple ASCII text files. Therefore, the skills to be able to read a content of such text files is imperative.
Fortunately there is a cat command which assists a user to read a content of a given file or concatenate several files and display their content to the screen.
